This React.js demonstration client uses the React component, which can be embedded into your Javascript applications, or it can be used as a guide to implementing the charts in your own language or framework. Charts do have a lot of implementational oddities and caveats, which often need a clinical reviewere to pick up, so if you do implement your own charting, you MUST make sure a competent clinical safety officer with experience in paediatrics and growth charts has signed it off.

We have attempted to build into the React client the best of growth chart theory and practice, including guidance given to us by the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts Project Board.

### Pink and Blue no longer used for the charts

It was felt that representing boys' charts with blue lines and girls' charts with pink lines did not really fit with 21st Century sensibilities of sex and gender. A Project Board decision was made to remove these colours and simply render the charts in monochrome black/grey, as well as some alternative colour options, which you can see in the demo.
