# RCPCH Growth Charts - React Client


## Key Notes
Built in React 16.13.1, using the Semantic UI (React) 0.88.2 styling library.
It is currently relies on the server running on port 5000 of localhost

It differs from the Flask client in that the measurement form accepts only one measurement at a time.
In the Flask client, if height and weight are both entered, a BMI is automatically calculated.
This does not happen on the React Client.
