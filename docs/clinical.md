# Clinical notes regarding the React client

We have attempted to build into the React client the best of growth chart theory and practice, including guidance given to us by the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts Project Board.

## Specific points regarding user interface

### Pink and Blue no longer used for the charts

- It was felt that representing boys' charts with blue lines and girls' charts with pink lines did not really fit with 21st Century sensibilities of sex and gender. A Project Board decision was made to remove these colours and simply render the charts in monochrome black/grey.
